rfc - for react function component
1.props - are simply the properties which we could change every time we create website 
2.write {props.name_of_prop} instead of writing text inside div tags

1.useState is used to add our info and update it accordingly
2.This is way to write -> const[text,setText] = useState('enter text');
3.now above 'enter text' in useState is default text .
4.if we need to channge our inside content just write -> setText='your info what you want to write' ie use variable setText and update accordingly.
5. inplace of setText we can  use any variable name 


# {text.length} tells about the length of charecters
# {text.split} tells about number of words
